# dailyMovieAndRandomMovieGenerator
A website that recommends movies to the user. With over 1000+ movies to explore.


This project was done to practice and develop my efficiency of file managment, cross-file projects, form/html manipulation, and database manipulation. 
In order to access this website just download the files and launch the server using the "Live Server" extension in VS Code.
